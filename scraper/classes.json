    "description": "The objective of this course is to provide the students with the concepts necessary to enable them to:  a) identify the abstract services common to all operating system, b) define the basic system components that support the operating system's machine independent abstractions on particular target architectures, c) consider how the design and implementation of different systems components interact and constrain one another, not merely how one or two important parts work in isolation, and d) understand the means by which fundamental problems in operating systems can be analyzed and addressed.  Programming assignments address topics including process creation, inter-process communication, system call implementation, process scheduling and virtual memory.  Laboratory exercises primarily focus on use of tools and concepts required for the programming assignments but include a small number of independent topics.  Prerequisite:  EECS 388, EECS 348, and upper-level EECS eligibility.",
