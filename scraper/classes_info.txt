BIOL 413
Biology - The Tree of Life ( 4 ) Fall 2025
A tour of the tree of life that introduces the major groups of organisms on Earth, their important traits, phylogenetic relationships, life histories, roles in global ecosystems, and interactions with humanity. Our primary guide to this tour is the “Tree of Life,” a branching diagram (phylogenetic tree) that illustrates how life evolved over the few billion years. Learning to read and interpret phylogenetic trees is central to the course, with lessons addressing general tree literacy, as well as advanced topics like mapping traits onto trees and reconstructing their evolution, interpreting fossils and timetrees, and biogeography. Weekly in-person and virtual labs offer opportunities for students to interact directly with physical specimens while also gaining practical experience with simple algorithms and software applications that can be used to reconstruct and interpret how major groups of organisms evolved over time. Two of the four credit hours from this course will apply towards BIOL lab elective requirements numbered 400 or higher for biology majors. Prerequisite: BIOL 152 or BIOL 153, or consent of the instructor.

African & African-American St - Social Media & Afrcn Pop Cult ( 3 ) Fall 2025
This course deals with popular creative forms and critical commentaries (re)produced or/and circulated by ordinary people - as opposed to the social and political elites - in the context of social media in Africa. Social media in Africa stages an unprecedented explosion of new popular forms, and digital genres circulate the perspectives of everyday people. With the understanding that popular culture is an arena in which non-elite subjects in different African countries create aesthetic forms, we will examine in this course the implications of literary and cultural expressions from different regions of Africa that are born-digital and remediated modes of subverting power and the normative culture. Students will explore how forms of popular culture-including Nollywood films, and other expressive forms on YouTube and other social media-serve as a running commentary both on contemporary Africa as well as on historical processes and changes in the continent.

African & African-American St - Art and the Sea ( 3 ) Fall 2025
This class takes visual and material culture of the ocean as a jumping off point for considering how representations of the sea articulate questions and concerns that are political, cultural, and environmental. Examining works ranging from maps, Indigenous art, paintings, literature, and film, students will consider the formal challenges of representation, and the practical challenges of navigation, that arise from human engagement with maritime space. Emphasis will be placed on the sea as a site of cultural and existential encounter. Concepts and approaches considered will include ecocriticism, the Black Atlantic, post-colonial theory, and performance studies. From the political importance of the sea to early modern empires, to the vital urgency of understanding and altering the human impact on the health of the oceans, we will explore how representing the sea is connected with understanding its power and its fragility. This course is offered at the 300 and 500 levels with additional work required at the 500 level. Not open to students with credit in HA 573/AAAS 573. (Same as HA 373.)

ANTH 212
Anthropology - Archaeological Myths&Realities ( 3 / GE11 ) Fall 2025
Archaeology is concerned with explaining mysteries of the human past ranging from the origins of human beings to the rise and fall of civilizations. This course is designed to guide students in investigations of mysteries that capture the popular imagination, but which many scientists do not wish to discuss. What is the scientific evidence for the Biblical account of Creation, the Great Flood, or the Tower of Babel? Was the Great Pyramid encoded with lost knowledge or predictions of the future? Did Chinese, Africans, Celts, or Vikings visit the Americas before Columbus? Is Stonehenge an astronomical observatory? Who built the giant statues on Easter Island? Where are the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria? The methods and theories of archaeology and anthropology will be used to address these and other questions. We will develop methods of evaluating information available from various published and online sources to judge when a claim represents a revolutionary new idea or a strategy for extracting money from the uninformed? Students will learn to be critical consumers of scientific and non-scientific information, and our goal will be to identify ways to be skeptical while maintaining an open mind when confronted with conflicting claims.

Anthropology - Strategies for Survival ( 3 / GLBC ) Fall 2025
This course explores the major inventions and strategies humans have implemented throughout their long history to secure their survival. The class is meant as a tribute to human creativity, flexibility and resilience. It is designed for students to delve in the depth of the rich ethnographic and archaeological record to illustrate the diversity of small-scale societies and traditions across the world and throughout our prehistory. We will investigate human adaptive responses along four major themes: 1) population control with life-or-death strategies, such as infanticide or mating taboos, 2) Food procurement via hunting, gathering or farming, 3) invention and technological innovation, such as stone tools, fire, pottery, and finally 4) social competition, as implemented through warfare or gifts and counter-gifts. These issues will be illustrated by archaeological and ethnographic case studies to establish when in our prehistory these adaptive mechanisms were adopted and how they have evolved through time.

Anthropology - Shamanism Past and Present ( 3 ) Fall 2025
This course explores shamanism, broadly defined as the practice of gaining insight through the use of ecstatic techniques (dance, drumming, trance, vision quests, and the use of psychotropic substances) for the purpose of interpreting existence and healing illnesses, through a consideration of theories and evidence for its practice from Upper Paleolithic times to the present day. Examples from the ancient cultures of Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas are used to explore current theoretical approaches in order to identify shamans and shamanism in the past. Issues of identifying shamans and shamanism in art and archaeological contexts are discussed. The course also explores the role that shamanism plays in a wide variety of cultures. The principal goal of the course is to provide a reasoned, critical interpretation of shamanism in the context of contemporary debates about its definition and active practice. Prerequisite: ANTH 108 or ANTH 110 or ANTH 150 or ANTH 151 or ANTH 160 or ANTH 162 or ANTH 308 or ANTH 310 or ANTH 360 or permission of instructor.
